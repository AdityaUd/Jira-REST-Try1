## 1. Timezones – 
The earth is a spherical object revolving around the sun and rotating along its moving axis.  The physical locations on earth , countries and continents receive sunlight at different times compared to next continent. Considering the sunrise and sunset times of a country , mornings and nights were set for each land. India has the same time even though the sunrise and sunset times are not the same for Gujrat and Assam. On the other-hand, USA has 4 timezones – East coast , Central , Midwest , Western times (each decreasing by 1hr from east to west) .

## 3.Rest API ( Representational State Transfer) – 
A connection between our system and on the online server is REST . Common functions passed through this connection are :
-GET – To retrieve data / display it after accessing it from a URL.
-PATCH / POST – To send data to server asking for it perform specific actions inside a URL. Creations or conversion of resources. 
-PUT – To modify or replace an existing resource in a URL with new information.
-DEL – To remove a resource from a URL. 

| Restful API| Restless API |
| ---------------| -----------------|
|Utilizes standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.| May not strictly follow all the CRUD principles of REST. |
|Uses resource-based URLs to represent different endpoints.| Can use resource-based URLs or more action-oriented URLs|
|Emphasizes statelessness, where each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request, without relying on server-side sessions. | Doesn't strictly adhere to statelessness, as it may use server-side sessions or store some state on the server to maintain user context.|
|Supports caching to improve performance and reduce server load.|May or may not support caching, depending on the design choices.|
